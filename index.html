            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects
                fall
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
                and just the
                kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
                intrigued by
                are
                as follows, in order of priority:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol
                    (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
                </li>
                <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when
                    the
                    audience
                    size
                    exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                    constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>

            </p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
            the
            research
            to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            <p>

                    Exotic dance moves
                </b>
            </h2>

            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To
                answer your
                question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br></p>

            <p> Polynesian chicken dance
            <ul class="not-points">
                <li>
                    A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would
                    dance
                    around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
                </li>
            </ul>

            Icelandic brownian shuffle
            <ul class="not-points">
                <li>
                    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
                    which
                    involved
                    huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably
                    tiny,
                    very
                    rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modem
                    styles
                    such
                    as
                    Twerking.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Arctic robot dance
            <ul class="not-points">
                <li>
                    An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                    discovered a
                    new
                    dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of
                    Northern
                    Alaska
                    and
                    Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
                    really
                    cold.
                </li>
